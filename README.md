A template for making discord bots with [Poise](https://docs.rs/poise/latest/poise/) & [SQLx](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx) postgres. 

Code is over-commented just to make sure parts are explained so you can remove some if you decide to use this!

Make sure to create a `./migrations` folder to make it run without no migrations and to change the name of the project in `Cargo.toml`

To use migrations look at the guide for the [SQLx CLI](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx/blob/main/sqlx-cli/README.md)
